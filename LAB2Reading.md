What is a text editor?
A text editor is software that allows you to write and manage text.
An example is code used to build a website.
It may be accessed either as via website or an application on your computer.
An example of text editors that may be pre-installed to your computer are Text Edit (installed on Mac Computers) and NotePad (installed on Windows).
What features should you look for in a text editor?
Code completion:
• Displays possible suggestions based on what you originally typed
• Closes tag/ bracket/ quotation marks
• Efficiently write HTML and CSS (eg Emmet – shorthand language that allows you to type code efficiently)
Syntax highlighting:
• Color codes attributes and elements for ease of reading to identify any errors in your code
Themes
• Allows you to change the background of your text editor thus may reduce eye strain
Add extension
• The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
Important information to Note
1.) When using the text editor that was pre-installed to your computer, create your code in plain text
2.) Create a folder to save your website
3.) When saving files, assure that the appropriate extension is at the end of the file names ( Eg. Index.html or style.css)
